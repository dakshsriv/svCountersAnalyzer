problem 1: These are are not counters:value types:
                   'POLICY_ENGINE-IP-156': 'CONTROL',
                   'POLICY_ENGINE-IP-2': 'PATH',

Problem 2: values should be numbers
                   'POLICY_ENGINE-AdminDiscards-Upstream(bytes)': '314,985,153,686',
                   'POLICY_ENGINE-AdminDiscards-Upstream(pkts)': '1,765,624,632',

Then you can insert these values into DB



Get a list of all counters from DB
SELECT DISTINCT counter FROM counters;

show list in the left pane

When someone selects a counter

Then  get all values of a specific counter
SELECT * FROM counters WHERE counter='POLICY_ENGINE-AdminDiscards-Upstream(bytes)' ORDER BY timestamp;

show the graph!!!
